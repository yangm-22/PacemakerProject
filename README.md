# Pacemaker Project
This project is based on the pacemaker specifications of [Boston Scientific]. For this project, a simulated pacemaker was built to visually and functionally represent the various functions of modern pacemakers. 

This project was completed in a team of 5 where there were 3 members on the Simulink team and 2 members on the DCM/GUI team. I was on the DCM/GUI team where we created the following features using model-based code generation and a Python GUI: 
1. 10 unique pacemaker modes (including AOO, VOO, AAI, VVI, AOOR, VOOR, AAIR, VVIR, DDD, DDDR)
2. Real-time electrocardiogram display from the ventricle and atrium readings
3. Locally encrypted data storage
